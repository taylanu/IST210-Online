Individual designs vary but certain entities and relationships are needed to support the problem.
The suggested design includes 7 tables.  
Your design provided adequate entities for the specified case.

Your Package entity should be linked to Tasks instead of Packing_List. Also, a Content and an Assignment entity are required here. The relationship between Package and Item should be zero or many to one and only one (You reversed it). Your Package entity lack of FK.
